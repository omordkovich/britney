Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now

My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Oh, because
