Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
